# Focus Reader for Claude

A Chrome extension that improves readability on Claude.ai with customizable fonts, spacing, and bionic reading.

Built this for myself because my brain was fried and I couldn't focus. Maybe it'll help you too.

## Features

**Typography Controls**
- Font family (including dyslexia-friendly options like Atkinson Hyperlegible and Lexend)
- Line height
- Letter spacing
- Word spacing

**Bionic Reading**
- Bolds the first portion of each word to anchor your eyes
- Adjustable intensity and weight
- Set to 0% to disable and just use typography settings

## Installation

2. **Open Chrome** and go to `chrome://extensions`

3. **Enable Developer Mode** (toggle in the top-right corner)
